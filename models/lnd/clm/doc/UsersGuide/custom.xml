<title>How to customize the configuration for a case with &clm;</title>

<para>
The <ulink url="&cesmwebmodelrel;cesm">
&cesmrel; User's Guide</ulink> gives you the details on how to create, setup, build, and run
a case. That is the document to give you the details on using the &cesm; scripts. The purpose 
of this document is to give you the details when using &cesm; with &clm; on how to customize
and use advanced features in &clm;. You should be familiar with the &cesmrel; User's Guide and
how to setup cases with &cesmrel; before referring to this document.
</para>
<para>
In this chapter we deal with three different ways of customizing a case: Choosing a compset,
Customizing Configuration options, and customizing the &clm; Namelist. There are many different
compsets that use &clm; and many are setup to enable special features of &clm; from the start. So
the first thing you want to be familiar with are the different options in the compsets. The 
next section shows the different options for customizing the configuration options for
&clm;.
Here we introduce the &clm; &configure; and &buildnml; scripts and how using the options in
&envbuild; and &envrun; you can customize the configuration and the
namelist.

<title>Choosing a compset using &clm;</title>

<para>
When setting up a new case one of the first choices to make is which "component
set" (or compset) to use. The
compset refers to which component models are used as well as specific settings for them. We label the different
types of compsets with a different letter of the alphabet from "A" (for all data model) to "X" (for all dead model).
The compsets of interest when working with &clm; are the "I" compsets (which contain
&clm; with a data atmosphere model
and a stub ocean, and stub sea-ice models), "E" and "F" compsets (which contain &clm;
with the active atmosphere model (&cam;),
prescribed sea-ice model, and a data ocean model), and "B" compsets which have all active components. Below we
go into details on the "I" compsets which emphasize &clm; as the only active model, and just mention the two other categories.
</para>
<para>
When working with &clm; you usually want to start with a relevant "I" compset before moving to the more
complex cases that involve other active model components. The "I" compsets can exercise
&clm; in a way that
is similar to the coupled modes, but with much lower computational cost and faster turnaround times.

<title>Customizing the &clm; setup</title>
<para>
The "Creating a Case" section of the 
<ulink url="&cesmwebmodelrel;cesm">&cesmrel; Scripts
User's-Guide</ulink>
gives instructions on creating a case. What is of interest here is how to customize your
use of &clm; for the case that you created.
</para>
<para>
For &clm; when &previewnml;, &casebld;, or &caserun; are called there are two steps that take place:
</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>The &clm; "&configure;" script is called to setup the build-time
configuration for &clm; (more information on &configure; is given in
<xref linkend="clm_configure_script"></xref>). The env variables
for &configure; are locked after the &casebld; step. So the results of the &clm; &configure;
are locked after the build has taken place.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The &clm; "&buildnml;" script is called to generate the
run-time namelist for &clm; (more information on &buildnml; is given below in
<xref linkend="nl_def"></xref>.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>
When customizing your case at the &setup; step you are able to modify the process by effecting either one
or both of these steps. The &clm; "&configure;" and "&buildnml;" scripts are both available in the "models/lnd/clm/bld" 
directory in the distribution. Both of these scripts have a "-help" option that is useful to examine to see what
types of options you can give either of them.
</para>
<para>
There are five different types of customization for the configuration that we will 
discuss: &clmrel; build-time options, &clmrel; run-time options, User Namelist,
other noteworthy &cesmrel;  configuration items, the &clm; &configure; script options, and 
the &clm; &buildnml; script options.
</para>
<para>
Information on all of the script, configuration, build and run items is found under 
<filename>scripts/ccsm_utils/Case.template</filename>
in the

<varlistentry>
<term>&CLMCONFIG;</term><listitem> 
<para>
<anchor id="CLMCONFIG"></anchor>
The option &CLMCONFIG; is all about passing command line arguments to the &clm; &configure; script. It is important
to note that some compsets, may already put a value into the &CLMCONFIG; variable. You can still add more
options to your &CLMCONFIG; but make sure you add to what is already there rather than replacing it. Hence,
we recommend using the "-append" option to the xmlchange script. In
<xref linkend="clm_configure_script"></xref>
below we will go into more details on options that can be customized in the &clm; "&configure;" script. It's
also important to note that the &clmbuildnml; script may already invoke certain &clm; &configure; options and as such those
command line options are NOT going to be available to change at this step (nor would you want to change them).
The options to &clm; &configure; are given with the "-help" option which is given in
<xref linkend="clm_configure_script"></xref>.
</para>
<note>
<para>
&CLMCONFIG; is locked after the &casebld; script is run. If you want to change something in &CLMCONFIG; you'll need to
clean the build and rerun &casebld;. The other env variables can be changed at run-time so are never locked.

<term>&CLMBLDNML;</term><listitem> 
<para>
<anchor id="CLMBLDNML"></anchor>
The option &CLMBLDNML; is for passing options to the &clm; "&buildnml;" script. As with the &clm; "&configure;"
script the &clm; &clmbuildnml; may already invoke certain options and as such those options will NOT be available to be
set here. The best way to see what options can be sent to the "&buildnml;" script is to do
</para>
<screen width="99">
> cd models/lnd/clm/bld
> ./&buildnml; -help
</screen>
<para>
Here is the output from the above.
</para>
<screen width="99">
./&buildnml_help;
</screen>
<para>
The &clmbuildnml; script already sets the resolution and mask as well as the &clm; &configure; file,
and defines an input namelist and namelist input file, and the output namelist directory, and sets
the start-type (from <envar>RUN_TYPE</envar>), namelist options (from &CLMNAMELIST;), 
co2_ppmv (from <envar>CCSM_CO2_PPMV</envar>, co2_type (from &CLMCO2;), lnd_frac (from <envar>LND_DOMAIN_PATH</envar> and <envar>LND_DOMAIN_FILE</envar>), 
l_ncpl (from <envar>LND_NCPL</envar>, glc_grid, glc_smb, glc_nec (from <envar>GLC_GRID</envar>, <envar>GLC_SMB</envar>, and <envar>GLC_NEC</envar>), 
and "clm_usr_name" is set (to &CLMUSRDAT; >when the grid is set to &CLMUSRDAT;.
Hence only the following different options can be set:
</para>
<para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>-chk_res</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>-sim_year</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>-verbose</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>
<para>
"-chk_res" ensures that the resolution chosen is supported by &clm;. If the resolution is NOT supported
it will cause the &clm; &buildnml; to abort when run. So when either &previewnml;, &casebld; or &caserun; is
executed it will abort early. Since, the &cesm; scripts only support certain resolutions anyway, in general
this option is NOT needed in the context of running &cesm; cases.
</para>

<para>
"-clm_demand" asks the &buildnml; step to require that the list of variables
entered be set. Typically, this is used to require that optional filenames be used and ensure
they are set before continuing. For example, you may want to require that
<varname>fpftdyn</varname> be set to get dynamically changing vegetation types. To do this
you would do the following.
<screen width="99">
> ./xmlchange &CLMBLDNML;="-clm_demand fpftdyn"
</screen>
To see a list of valid variables that you could set do this:
<screen width="99">
> cd models/lnd/clm/doc
> ../bld/&buildnml; -clm_demand list
</screen>
</para>
<note>
 <para>
Using a 20th-Century transient compset or the <envar>20thC_transient</envar> use-case
using &CLMUSECASE; would set this as well, but would also use 
dynamic nitrogen and aerosol deposition files, so using <envar>-clm_demand</envar> would be a way 
to get <emphasis>just</emphasis> dynamic vegetation types and NOT the other files as well.
</para>
</note>

<para>
"-drydep" adds the dry-deposition namelist to the driver. This is a driver namelist, but adding
the option here has &clm; &buildnml; create the <filename>drv_flds_in</filename> file that the
driver will copy over and use.
</para>

<para>
"-ignore_ic_date" ignores the Initial Conditions (IC) date completely for finding initial condition
files to startup from. Without this option or the "-ignore_ic_year" option below, the date of the
file comes into play.
</para>

<para>
"-ignore_ic_year" ignores the Initial Conditions (IC) year for finding initial condition
files to startup from. The date is used, but the year is ignored. Without this option or the 
"-ignore_ic_date" option below, the date and year of the file comes into play.
</para>

<para>
When "-irrig" is used &buildnml; will try to find surface datasets that have the
irrigation model enabled.
</para>

<para>
"-megan" adds the MEGAN model Biogenic Volatile Organic Componds (BVOC) namelist to the driver. 
This is a driver namelist, but adding the option here has &clm; &buildnml; create the <filename>drv_flds_in</filename> 
file that the driver will copy over and use.
</para>

<para>
"-note" adds a note to the bottom of the namelist file, that gives the details of how &buildnml; was called, giving
the specific command-line options given to it.
</para>

<para>
"-rcp" is used to set the representative concentration pathway for the future scenarios
you want the data-sets to simulate conditions for, in the input
datasets. To list the valid options do the following:
</para>
<screen width="99">
> cd models/lnd/clm/doc
> ../bld/&buildnml; -rcp list
</screen>

<para>
"-sim_year" is used to set the simulation year you want the data-sets to simulate conditions for in the input
datasets. The simulation "year" can also be a range of years in order to do simulations
with changes in the dataset values as the simulation progresses. To list the valid 
options do the following:

Example, you want to set <varname>hist_dov2xy</varname> to <varname>.false.</varname>
so that you get vector output to your history files. To do so edit
&envrun; and add a setting for <varname>hist_dov2xy</varname>.
So do the following:
<screen width="99">

what the names will need to be. For example if your &CLMUSRDAT; will 
be "1x1_boulderCO", with a "navy" land-mask, constant simulation year range, for 1850,
the following will list what your filenames should be:

<title>User Namelist</title>
<para>
&CLMNAMELIST; as described above allows you to set any
extra namelist items you would like to appear in your namelist.
However, it only allows you a single line to enter namelist items, and strings must
be quoted with &amp;apos; which is a bit awkward. If you have a long list of namelist
items you want to set (such as a long list of history fields) a convenient way to do it
is to add to the &usernlclm; that is created after the &setup; command runs.
The file needs to be in valid &FORTRAN; namelist format (with the exception that the namelist name &amp;namelist
and the end of namelist marker "/" are excluded". The &previewnml; or &caserun;
step will abort if there are syntax errors.
All the variable names must be valid and the values must be valid for the datatype and any restrictions
for valid values for that variable. Here's an example &usernlclm;
namelist that sets a bunch of history file related items, to create output history files
monthly, daily, every six and 1 hours.

You do NOT need to specify the namelist group that the variables are in
because the &clm; &buildnml; knows the namelist that specific variable names belong to, and
it puts them there.
</para>
</note>
Obviously, all of this would be difficult to put in the &CLMNAMELIST;
variable, especially having to put &amp;apos; around all the character strings. For
more information on the namelist variables being set here and what they mean, see
the section on &clm; namelists below, as well as the namelist definition that gives
details on each variable.

<sect2 id="precedence">
<title>Precedence of Options</title>
<para>
Note: The precedence for setting the values of namelist variables with the
different &envbuild;, &envrun;  options is (highest to lowest):
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Namelist values set by specific command-line options, like, -d, -sim_year
(i.e.  &CLMBLDNML; &envbuild; variable)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Values set on the command-line using the -namelist option,
(i.e. &CLMNAMELIST; &envrun; variable)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Values read from the file specified by -infile,
(i.e.  &usernlclm; file)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Datasets from the -clm_usr_name option,
(i.e.  &CLMUSRDAT; &envrun; variable)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Values set from a use-case scenario, e.g., -use_case

<title>Setting Your Initial Conditions File</title>
<para>
Especially with &clmcn; starting from initial conditions is very important. Even
with &clmsp; it takes many simulation years to get the model fully spunup. There
are a couple different ways to provide an initial condition file.

<member><xref linkend="adding_finidat_in_XML"></xref></member>
</simplelist>
<note>
<para>
Your initial condition file MUST agree with the surface dataset you are using
to run the simulation. If the two files do NOT agree you will get a
run-time about a mis-match in PFT weights, or in the number of PFT's or
columns. To get around this you'll need to use <xref linkend="interpinic"></xref>
to interpolate your initial condition dataset.
</para>
</note>
</para>

<sect3 id="hybrid_IC">
<title>Doing a hybrid simulation to provide initial conditions</title>
<para>
The first option is to setup a hybrid simulation and give a 
<envar>RUN_REFCASE</envar> and <envar>RUN_REFDATE</envar> to specify the 
reference case simulation name to use.
When you setup most cases, at the standard resolutions of "f09" or "f19" it
will already do this for you. For example, if you run an "I2000CN" compset
at "f09_g16" resolution the following settings will already be done for you.
<screen width="99">
./xmlchange RUN_TYPE=hybrid,RUN_REFCASE=I2000CN_f09_g16_c100503,RUN_REFDATE=0001-01-01,GET_REFCASE=TRUE
</screen>
Setting the <envar>GET_REFCASE</envar> option to <literal>TRUE</literal> means it
will copy the files from the:
<filename>$DIN_LOC_ROOT/ccsm4_init/I2000CN_f09_g16_c100503/0001-01-01</filename>
directory. Note, that the <literal>RUN_REFCASE</literal> and
<literal>RUN_REFDATE</literal> variables are expanded to get the directory name
above. If you do NOT set <envar>GET_REFCASE</envar> to <literal>TRUE</literal> then
you will need to have placed the file in your run directory yourself. In either
case, the file is expected to be named: 
<literal>$RUN_REFCASE.clm2.r.$RUN_REFDATE-00000.nc</literal> with the variables 
expanded of course.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="branch_IC">
<title>Doing a branch simulation to provide initial conditions</title>
<para>
The setup for running a branch simulation is essentially the same as for a hybrid.
With the exception of setting <envar>RUN_TYPE</envar> to <literal>branch</literal>
rather than <literal>hybrid</literal>. A branch simulation runs the case essentially
as restarting from it's place before to exactly reproduce it (but possibly output
more or different fields on the history files). While a hybrid simulation
allows you to change the configuration or run-time options, as well as use a different code base 
than the original case that may have fewer fields on it than a full restart file. 
The <envar>GET_REFCASE</envar> option works similarily for a branch case as for a hybrid.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="user_nl_clm_IC">
<title>Providing a finidat file in your &usernlclm; file</title>
<para>
Setting up a branch or hybrid simulation requires the initial condition file
to follow a standard naming convention, and a standard input directory if you
use the <envar>GET_REFCASE</envar> option. If you want to name your file willy
nilly and place it anywhere, you can set it in your &usernlclm; file as in this
example.
<screen width="99">

Like other datasets, if you want to use a given initial condition file to
be used for all (or most of) your cases you'll want to put it in the XML

resolution dependent, and dependent on the number of PFT's and other variables

Sometimes for various reasons you want to remove all the history fields either
because you want to do testing without any output, or you only want a very small
custom list of output fields rather than the default extensive list of fields.
By default only the primary history files are active, so technically using
<varname>hist_fexcl1</varname> explained in the first example, you could list 
<emphasis>ALL</emphasis> of the history fields that are output in 
<varname>hist_fexcl1</varname> and then you wouldn't get any output. However, as
the list is very extensive this would be a cumbersome thing to do. So to facilitate
this <varname>hist_empty_htapes</varname> allows you to turn off all default output.
You can still use <varname>hist_fincl1</varname> to turn your own list of fields
on, but you then start from a clean slate. 
A sample user namelist &usernlclm; turning off all history 
fields and then activating just a few selected fields (ground and vegetation temperatures
and absorbed solar radiation) is:
<example>
<title>Example &usernlclm; namelist removing all history fields</title>
<screen width="99">
 hist_empty_htapes = .true.
 hist_fincl1 = 'TG', 'TV', 'FSA'

Note, you could also build adding the "-noio" option to &CLMCONFIG;. But, this would 
build the model without history output and you wouldn't be able to add that in later.

<sect3 id="hist_averaging">
<title>Various ways to change history output averaging flags</title>
<para>
There are two ways to change the averaging of output history fields. The first is using
<varname>hist_avgflag_pertape</varname> which gives a default value for each history
stream, the second is when you add fields using <varname>hist_fincl*</varname>, you add
an averaging flag to the end of the field name after a colon (for example 'TSOI:X', would
output the maximum of TSOI).
The types of averaging that can be done are:
<simplelist>
<member><emphasis>A</emphasis> Average, over the output interval.</member>
<member><emphasis>I</emphasis> Instantaneous, output the value at the output interval.</member>
<member><emphasis>X</emphasis> Maximum, over the output interval.</member>
<member><emphasis>M</emphasis> Minimum, over the output interval.</member>
</simplelist>

The default averaging depends on the specific fields, but for most fields is an average.
A sample user namelist &usernlclm; making the monthly output
fields all averages (except TSOI for the first two streams and FIRE for the 5th stream), 
and adding auxiliary file streams for instantaneous (6-hourly), 
maximum (daily), minimum (daily), and average (daily). For some of the fields we
diverge from the per-tape value given and customize to some different type of 
optimization.
<example>

</para>

<para>
In the example we put the same list of fields on each of the tapes: soil-temperature,
ground temperature, vegetation temperature, emitted longwave radiation, reflected
solar radiation, sensible heat, total latent-heat, and total water storage. We also
modify the soil-temperature for the primary and secondary auxiliary tapes by outputting
them for a maximum instead of the prescribed per-tape of average and instantaneous
respectively. For the tertiary auxiliary tape we output ground temperature instantaneous
instead of as a maximum, and for the fourth auxiliary tape we output vegetation
temperature instantaneous instead of as a minimum. Finally, for the fifth auxiliary
tapes we output <varname>FIRE</varname> instantaneously instead of as an average.
</para>

<note>
<para>
We also use <varname>hist_empty_htapes</varname> as in the previous example,
so we can list ONLY the fields that we want on the primary history tapes.

<sect3 id="hist_vector">
<title>Outputting history files as a vector in order to analyze
the plant function types within gridcells</title>
<para>
By default the output to history files are the grid-cell average of all land-units, and
vegetation types within that grid-cell, and output is on the
full 2D latitude/longitude grid with ocean masked out. Sometimes it's important to
understand how different land-units or vegetation types are acting within a grid-cell.
The way to do this is to output history files as a 1D-vector of all land-units and vegetation
types. In order to display this, you'll need to do extensive post-processing to make sense
of the output. Often you may only be interested in a few points, so once you figure out the
1D indices for the grid-cells of interest, you can easily view that data. 1D vector output
can also be useful for single point datasets, since it's then obvious that all data is for the
same grid cell.
</para>
<para>
To do this you use <varname>hist_dov2xy</varname> which is an array of rank six for 
each history stream. Set it to
<varname>.false.</varname> if you want one of the history streams to be a 1D vector. 
You can also use <varname>hist_type1d_pertape</varname> if you want to average over all the:
Plant-Function-Types, columns, land-units, or grid-cells.
A sample user namelist &usernlclm; leaving the primary monthly
files as 2D, and then doing grid-cell (GRID), column (COLS), 
and no averaging over auxiliary tapes output daily for a single field 
(ground temperature) is:
<example id="vector1D">

LAND and COLS are also options to the pertape averaging, but currently there is a bug
with them and they fail to work.
</para>
</warning>
</para>
<note>
<para>
Technically the default for <varname>hist_nhtfrq</varname> is for primary files
output monthly and the other auxiliary tapes for daily, so we don't actually have
to include <varname>hist_nhtfrq</varname>, we could use the default for it. Here
we specify it for clarity.
</para>
</note>
<caution>
<para>
Visualizing global 1D vector files will take effort. You'll probably want
to do some post-processing and possibly just extract out single points of interest
to see what is going on. Since, the output is a 1D vector, of only land-points
traditional plots won't be helpful. The number of points per grid-cell will also
vary for anything, but grid-cell averaging. You'll need to use the output fields
<varname>pfts1d_ixy</varname>, and <varname>pfts1d_jxy</varname>, to get the mapping
of the fields to the global 2D array. <varname>pfts1d_itype_veg</varname> gives you 
the PFT number for each PFT. Most likely you'll want to do this analysis in a 
data processing tool (such as NCL, Matlab, Mathmatica, IDL, etcetera that is able
to read and process &netcdf; data files).

<title>Customizing the &datm; Namelist and Streams files</title>
<para>
When running "I" compsets with &clm; you use the &datm; model to give atmospheric

</orderedlist>
The <ulink url="&cesmwebmodelrel;/data8/doc/book1.html">
Data Model Documentation</ulink> gives the details of all the options for the data
models and for &datm; specifically. It goes into detail on all namelist items both for
&datm; and for &datm; streams.  So here we won't list 
ALL of the &datm; namelist options, nor go into great details about stream files. But, 
we will talk about a few of the different options that are relevant for running with 
&clm;. All of the options for changing the namelists or stream files is done by editing
the <filename>user_nl_datm</filename> file.
</para>
<para>
Because, they aren't useful for work with &clm; we will NOT discuss any of the options 
for the main &datm; namelist. Use the &datm; Users Guide at the link above to find 
details of that. For the streams namelist we will discuss three items:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>
<emphasis>mapalgo</emphasis>
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
<emphasis>taxmode</emphasis>
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

</orderedlist>
And for the streams file itself we will discuss:
<simplelist>
<member> <emphasis>offset</emphasis> </member>
</simplelist>
Again everything else (and including the above items) are discussed in the Data Model
User's Guide. Of the above the last three: offset, taxmode and tintalgo are all closely
related and have to do with the time interpolation of the &datm; data.
</para>
<para>
<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>mapalgo</term> <listitem> 
<para>
<varname>mapalgo</varname> sets the spatial interpolation method to go from the
&datm; input data to the output &datm; model grid. The default is
<literal>bilinear</literal>. For &CLM1PT; we set it to <literal>nn</literal> to just
select the nearest neighbor. This saves time and we also had problems running the
interpolation for single-point mode.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>taxmode</term> <listitem> 
<para>
<varname>taxmode</varname> is the time axis mode. For &clm; we usually have it
set to <literal>cycle</literal> which means that once the end of the data is reached
it will start over at the beginning. The <literal>extend</literal> modes is used
have it use the last time-step of the forcing data once it reaches the end of forcing
data (or use the first time-step before it reaches where the forcing data starts).
See the warning below about the <literal>extend</literal> mode.
<warning>
<para>
<emphasis>THE <literal>extend</literal> OPTION NEEDS TO BE USED WITH CAUTION!</emphasis> 
It is only invoked by default for the &CLM1PT; mode and is only intended for the 
supported urban datasets to extend the data for a single time-step. If you have the 
model <emphasis>run extensively through periods in this mode you will effectively 
be repeating that last time-step over that entire period</emphasis>. This means the
output of your simulation will be worthless.
</para>
</warning>
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>offset (in the stream file)</term> <listitem> 
<para>
<varname>offset</varname> is the time offset in seconds to give to each stream
of data. Normally it is NOT used because the time-stamps for data is set correctly
for each stream of data. Note, the <varname>offset</varname> may NEED to be 
adjusted depending on the <varname>taxmode</varname> described above, or it may 
need to be adjusted to account for data that is time-stamped at the END of an 
interval rather than the middle or beginning of interval.  The 
<varname>offset</varname> can is set in the stream file rather than on the 
stream namelist. For data with a <varname>taxmode</varname> method of 
<literal>coszen</literal> the time-stamp needs to be for the beginning of the interval, 
while for other data it should be the midpoint. The <varname>offset</varname> can be 
used to adjust the time-stamps to get the data to line up correctly.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>tintalgo</term> <listitem> 
<para>
<varname>tintalgo</varname> is the time interpolation algorithm. For &clm; we usually
use one of three modes: <literal>coszen</literal>, <literal>nearest</literal>, or 
<literal>linear</literal>. We use <literal>coszen</literal> for solar data, 
<literal>nearest</literal> for precipitation data, and <literal>linear</literal>
for everything else. If your data is half-hourly or hourly, <literal>nearest</literal>
will work fine for everything. The <literal>coszen</literal> scaling is useful for
longer periods (three hours or more) to try to get the solar to match the cosine of
the solar zenith angle over that longer period of time. If you use
<literal>linear</literal> for longer intervals, the solar will cut out at night-time
anyway, and the straight line will be a poor approximation of the cosine of the
solar zenith angle of actual solar data. <literal>nearest</literal> likewise would
be bad for longer periods where it would be much higher than the actual values.
<note>
<para>
For <literal>coszen</literal> the time-stamps of the data should correspond to the
beginning of the interval the data is measured for. Either make sure the time-stamps
on the datafiles is set this way, or use the <varname>offset</varname> described above
to set it.
</para>
</note>
<note>
<para>
For <literal>nearest</literal> and <literal>linear</literal> the time-stamps of the 
data should correspond to the middle of the interval the data is measured for. Either 
make sure the time-stamps on the datafiles is set this way, or use the 
<varname>offset</varname> described above to set it.

In the sections below we go over each of the relevant <envar>DATM_MODE</envar> 
options and what the above &datm; settings are for each. This gives you examples
of actual usage for the settings. We also describe in what ways you might want 
to customize them for your own case.
</para>

<sect2 id="clmqian_mode_datm_settings">
<title>&CLMQIAN; mode and it's &datm; settings</title>
<para>
In &CLMQIAN; mode the Qian dataset is used which has 6-hourly
solar and precipitation data, and 3-hourly for everything else.
The dataset is divided into those three data streams: solar, precipitation,
and everything else (temperature, pressure, humidity and wind). The time-stamps
of the data were also adjusted so that they are the beginning of the interval
for solar, and the middle for the other two. Because, of this the
<varname>offset</varname> is set to zero, and the <varname>tintalgo</varname>
is: <literal>coszen</literal>, <literal>nearest</literal>, and 
<literal>linear</literal> for the solar, precipitation and other data
respectively. <varname>taxmode</varname> is set to <literal>cycle</literal>
and <varname>mapalgo</varname> is set to <literal>bilinear</literal> so that
the data is spatially interpolated from the input T62 grid to the grid the atmosphere
model is being run at.
</para>
<para>
Normally you wouldn't customize the &CLMQIAN; settings, but you might replicate
it's use for your own global data that had similar temporal characteristics.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="clm1pt_mode_datm_settings">
<title>&CLM1PT; mode and it's &datm; settings</title>
<para>
In &CLM1PT; mode the model is assumed to have half-hourly or hourly data
for a single-point. For the supported datasets that is exactly what it has.
But, if you add your own data you may need to make adjustments accordingly.
Using the &CLMUSRDAT; resolution you can easily extend this mode for your own 
datasets that may be regional or even global and could be at different temporal
frequencies. If you do so you'll need to make adjustments to your &datm; settings.
The dataset has all data in a single stream file. The time-stamps
of the data were also adjusted so that they are at the middle of the interval. 
Because, of this the <varname>offset</varname> is set to zero, and the 
<varname>tintalgo</varname> is set to <literal>nearest</literal>.
<varname>taxmode</varname> is set to <literal>extend</literal>
and <varname>mapalgo</varname> is set to <literal>nn</literal> so that
simply the nearest point is used.
</para>
<para>
If you are using your own data for this mode and it's not at least hourly
you'll want to adjust the &datm; settings for it. If the data is three or
six hourly, you'll need to divide it up into separate streams like in
&CLMQIAN; mode which will require fairly extensive changes to the &datm;
namelist and streams files. For an example of doing this see 
<xref linkend="own_force_streams"></xref>.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="cplhist_mode_datm_settings">
<title>&CPLHIST; mode and it's &datm; settings</title>
<para>
In &CPLHIST; mode the model is assumed to have 3-hourly for a global grid from
a previous &cesm; simulation. Like &CLMQIAN; mode the data is divided into 
three streams: one for precipitation, one for solar, and one for everything else.
The time-stamps for Coupler history files for &cesm; is at the end of the interval, 
so the offset needs to be set in order to adjust the time-stamps to what it needs
to be for the <varname>tintalgo</varname> settings. For precipitation 
<varname>taxmode</varname> is set to <literal>nearest</literal> so the
<varname>offset</varname> is set to <literal>-5400</literal> seconds so that 
the ending time-step is adjusted by an hour and half to the middle of the interval.
For solar <varname>taxmode</varname> is set to <literal>coszen</literal> so the
<varname>offset</varname> is set to <literal>-10800</literal> seconds so that 
the ending time-step is adjust by three hours to the beginning of the interval.
For everything else <varname>taxmode</varname> is set to 
<literal>linear</literal> so the <varname>offset</varname> is set to 
<literal>-5400</literal> seconds so that the ending time-step is adjusted by an 
hour and half to the middle of the interval.
</para>
<para>
Normally you wouldn't modify the &datm; settings for this mode. However, if you
had data at a different frequency than 3-hours you would need to modify the
<varname>offset</varname> and possibly the <varname>taxmode</varname>. The other
two things that you might modify would be the path to the data or
the domain file for the resolution (which is currently hardwired to f09). For
data at a different input resolution you would need to change the domain file
in the streams file to use a domain file to the resolution that the data comes in
on.

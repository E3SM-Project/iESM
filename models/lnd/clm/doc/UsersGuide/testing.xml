<title>Scripts for testing &clm;</title>

<para>
Technically, you could use the customization we gave in <xref linkend="customize"></xref>
to test various configuration and namelist options for &clm;. Sometimes, it's also
useful to have automated tests though to test that restarts give exactly the same 
results as without a restart. It's also useful to have automated tests to run over a
wide variety of configurations, resolutions, and namelist options. To do that we have
several different types of scripts set up to make running comprehensive testing of
&clm; easy. There are two types of testing scripts for &clm;. The first are the &cesm;
test scripts, which utilize the <command>create_newcase</command> scripts that we
shown how to use in this User's Guide. The second are a set of stand-alone scripts that
use the &clm; &configure; and &buildnml; scripts to build and test the model as well as
testing the &clm; tools as well. Below we will go into further details of how to use
both methods.

<title>Testing &clm; Using the &cesm; Test Scripts</title>

<para>
We first introduce the test scripts that work for all CESM components. We will
use the <command>create_test</command> and then the <command>create_test_suite</command>
scripts. The <command>create_test</command> runs a specific type of test, at a given
resolution, for a given compset using a given machine. There is a list of different
tests, but the "ERI" tests do several things at once, running from startup, as well
as doing exact branch and restart tests. So to run "ERI" testing at 2-degree with
the I1850CN compset on yellowstone_intel you do the following.
<screen width="99">
> cd scripts
> ./create_test -testname ERI.f19_g16.I1850CN.yellowstone_intel
> cd ERI.f19_g16.I1850CN.yellowstone_intel.$id
> ./ERI.f19_g16.I1850CN.yellowstone_intel.$id.build
> ERI.f19_g16.I1850CN.yellowstone_intel.$id.submit
</screen>
When the test is done it will update the file <filename>TestStatus</filename> with
either a PASS or FAIL message.
</para>
<para>
To run a suite of tests from a list of tests with syntax similar to above you use
<command>create_test_suite</command> as follows passing it a ASCII list of tests.
There are already some test lists in the
<filename>scripts/ccsm_utils/Testlists</filename> directory a few of which are specific
to &clm;. To run for the &clm; yellowstone test list, on yellowstone, you would do the
following:
<screen width="99">
> cd scripts
> ./create_test_suite -input_list ccsm_utils/Testlists/yellowstone.clm.auxtest
# Submit the suite of tests (note $id refers to the integer job number for this job)
> ./cs.submit.$id.yellowstone
# Later check the tests with...
> ./cs.status.$id
# The above will give a PASS or FAIL message for each test.

<title>Testing &clm; tools using the &clm; Stand-Alone Tools Testing Scripts</title>

<para>
In the <filename>models/lnd/clm/test/system</filename> directory there is
a set of test scripts that is specific to stand-alone &clm; tools. It allows
you to test the &clm; tools such as <command>mkgriddata</command> and 
<command>mksurfdata_map</command>. The main driver script is called
<filename>test_driver.sh</filename> and it is normally run interactively.
Like other scripts you can get help on it by running the 
"-help" option as: <command>test_driver.sh -help</command>. 
There is also a <filename>README</filename>
file that gives details about environment variables that can be given to
<command>test_driver.sh</command> to change it's operation.
</para>
<para>
To run tests interactively:
<screen width="99">
> cd models/lnd/clm/test/system
> ./test_driver.sh -i
</screen>
The output of the help option is as follows:
<screen width="99">
&clmtestdriver;
</screen>
A table of the list of tests and the machines they are run on is available from:

<title>Testing &ptclm; use the &ptclm; test script</title>

<para>
There is a simple test script for &ptclm; called <filename>testcases.csh</filename>
in the &ptclm; directory (<filename>scripts/ccsm_utils/Tools/lnd/clm/PTCLM</filename>).
The test script is setup to run on the machines: yellowstone, frankfurt,
yong, and titan. You simply run the script interactively. The script will write
out the status of tests to a file called: <filename>tc.job#.status</filename>.
</para>
<para>
There are a few environment variables that can be used with
<filename>testcases.csh</filename> to change it's operation.
<simplelist>
<member><envar>CESM_ROOT</envar>: To test with a separate root to &cesm; code set this
env variable to the root directory to use.</member>
<member><envar>CLM_SOFF</envar>: If set to <literal>TRUE</literal> - stop on first 
failed test rather than continuing to run.</member>
<member><envar>CLM_RETAIN_FILES</envar>: If set to <literal>FALSE</literal> - cleanup 
tools build first.</member>
<member><envar>DEBUG</envar>: If set to <literal>TRUE</literal> - setup cases, but 
do not build or run.</member>

One-line Summary:  Hi res mksurfdata datasets, glc bug-fix, new datasets, multi-instance, unstructured grid support
                   MEGAN model updated, RTM seperated and 10th degree grid option

Purpose of changes: 

   Changes to answers for science:

   * New "ngwh" harvest for surface datasets to fix issues in rcp6 and rcp8.5 land-use change datasets
   * Snow history output a bit differently so that you can do a full budget (only changes history fields)
   * Bug fix for GLC-MEC virtual columns, ice-albedo change for GLC-MEC
   * New surface datasets, initial-conditions and grid (gland5UM) for GLC-MEC
   * New datasets for f05, T31 and rcp6/rcp8.5 land-use change
     (fmax and organic soil high resolution datasets for mksurdata_map)

   New Capabilities for Science (functionality):

   * Multiple instance capability
   * Support to run CLM on non lat/lon and cubed sphere and unstructured grids
   * New high resolution datasets available for creating surface datasets
     (most datasets at 10X the previous half-degree datasets [which are also available])
   * MEGAN model updated to general format to model 120 species
   * Option for tenth degree RTM
   * New hi-res pct_glacer and topo files for creating mksurfdata

   Refactoring or changes to software Infrastructure:

   * New support for user-specification of model grids
   * CLM tool input dataset tool chain changed extensively
   * Remove CASA
   * Use RTM mapping files
   * RTM removed from CLM as a separate -- River Runoff Model Component
   * Add soilwater field to coupler for CARMA
   * CLM testing framework now uses the CESM test framework, rather than CLM stand-alone testing

One-line Summary:  New T31 datasets, add crop/irrigation in, remove unused CPP tokens, 
     fix urbanc_alpha and 2.5x3.33 datasets, Changes from Keith O on SNOWLIQ/SNOWICE
     Move cpl fld indicies to clm, move cpl_* dir up a level, add cpl_share dir
     Update for ESMF metadata, bug fixes, use drv pio namelist, add in T341 datasets
     Use pio for all IO, make restart history files NetCDF.

Purpose of changes:

  Science changes:

    Add prognostic crop model (based on Agro-IBIS) as an option (from work by
    Sam Levis). When prognostic crop is active four new Plant Function Types (PFT's)
    become active for: corn, spring-temperate cereal, winter-temperate cereal, and
    soybean. We don't currently activate winter cereal's in our datasets, and our
    datasets only have prognostic crops over temperate latitudes (NOT near the
    equator). The model tracks planting and harvesting of the prognostic crops.
    Data for crop is only available for present-day conditions and NOT for transient
    simulations.

    Add irrigation model as an option (from work by Bill Sacks and Sam Levis). 
    When irrigation is active a dataset turns generic crop (not managed) into
    irrigated generic crop, the model takes runoff from RTM when crops need
    water.

  Software engineering changes:

   Use PIO (Parallel Input/Output package) for all Input/Output, make restart history 
   files NetCDF. Input and output files can be read/written in parallel using PIO.
   Remove a list of old CPP defines, remove misc/preproc.h files.

Describe any changes made to build system:

   Add -crop and -noio options to configure, remove -dust and -progsslt options
   Remove "numpft+1" option to -maxpft. maxpft can go up to 17 without crop and
   needs to be 21 for crop.

  -crop adds the CROP #ifdef. Removes the DUST, PROGSSLT, CLAMP CPP tokens.
  Also remove: DISTURB, COUP_WRF, NO_DAYLEN_VCMAX, TCX_REMOVE_SEE_NOTES_ABOVE, and
  L2R_Decomp, and some testing/debug CPP defines

  Removed generation of files misc.h and preproc.h

  Add darwin_intel build

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

   Remove Carbon_only and scaled_harvest options
   Add suplnitro option which can be set to: NONE, PROG_CROP_ONLY, or ALL

   Add new history output variables:

        A5TMIN   5-day running mean of min 2-m temperature                         (K)
        A10TMIN  10-day running mean of min 2-m temperature                        (K)
        GDD0     Growing degree days base  0C from planting                        (ddays)
        GDD8     Growing degree days base  8C from planting                        (ddays)
        GDD10    Growing degree days base 10C from planting                        (ddays)
        GDD020   Twenty year average of growing degree days base  0C from planting (ddays)
        GDD820   Twenty year average of growing degree days base  8C from planting (ddays)
        GDD1020  Twenty year average of growing degree days base 10C from planting (ddays)
        GDDPLANT Accumulated growing degree days past planting date for crop       (ddays)
        GDDHARV  Growing degree days (gdd) needed to harvest                       (ddays)
        GDDTSOI  Growing degree-days from planting (top two soil layers)           (ddays)
        QIRRIG    water added through irrigation                                   (mm/s)

     Change order of precedence so that
     use_case is AFTER -namelist -infile and clm_usr_name options.
     Thus values in your user_nl_clm file will be used instead of what's in
     the use_case.

     New precedence is...
       1. values set on the command-line using the -namelist option,
       2. values read from the file specified by -infile,
       3. datasets from the -clm_usr_name option,
       4. values set from a use-case scenario, e.g., -use_case
       5. values from the namelist defaults file.

     Add -co2_ppmv, -irrig, -rtm_res, and -rtm_tstep options to build-namelist

+     -co2_ppmv "value"        Set CO2 concentration to use when co2_type is constant (ppmv).
+     -irrig                   Seek surface datasets with irrigation turned on.
+     -rtm_res "resolution"    Specify river transport model resolution.
+     -rtm_tstep "seconds"     Specify river transport model time step size (seconds) (used if RTM on)

   Now co2_ppmv only shows up in namelist -- if co2_type is constant.
   And rtm_nsteps only shows up in namelist if RTM is on. build-namelist -list options
   no longer require a config_cache file to work.

   Remove old PIO namelist items, new drv namelist to control PIO for all components.

   I1850SPINUPCN compset uses MOAR data.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: 
   pft-physiology and RTM flow files in NetCDF
   finidat/fsurdat files for irrigation (for f09 and f10)
   New finidat/fsurdat/fpftdyn files for T31.
   Update frac and domain file for urbanc_alpha site
   New surface dataset for urbanc_alpha
   New grid/topo/frac/domain files for 2.5x3.33
   New point mode for crop: 1x1_numaIA and 1x1_smallvilleIA
   surface datasets for crop mode for: f19, f10, 1x1_numaIA, and 1x1_smallvilleIA
   (also crop datasets with crop AND irrigation on)
   finidat file for crop for f19
   Raw veg and lai datasets for mksurfdata for crop
   New datasets for glc_nec="10"
   Add in T341 datasets

Describe timing and memory performance:
    Crop adds some additional variables and if checks that may make small 
    differences in run-time and/or memory. Small section of clm_driver was 
    moved to a OMP loop. This should improve threading performance slightly.

===============================================================
Tag name:  clm4_0_14 in cesm1_0_2
Originator(s):  erik (erik)
Date: Tue Oct 19 13:12:36 MDT 2010
One-line Summary: Add in ice_runoff namelist, add in T31 initial conditions and
                  setup. Fix issues for single-point, mksurfdata/getregional 
                  scripts, add U10, T31 datafiles.

Purpose of changes:

  Science changes:

   Since, clm4.0.10 in the CESM1.0.1 release there have been several developments made
   to clm4 (bringing us up to CLM4.0.14).  A minor change
   was also made in how the normalization was done for the cosine of solar zenith
   angle scaling for Solar fields in the data atmosphere model.
   The 10-m wind field was added to the history files.

   New initial conditions files were added in for T31 For T31 ice_runoff is also
   turned off.

  Software engineering changes:

   Several new namelist items were added and few new history fields.
   There was also some fixes to test cases in the CLM test suite, and the test suite was
   changed to use aerosols from datm rather than CLM. mksurfdata.pl was changed
   so that pftdyn datasets are created on the fly, rather than having fixed text files.

   Add: usrname, nomv and pftdata options to mksurfdata.pl. Get RCP's working in 
   getregional script. Update getregional to handle ndep and aerdep streams, also get 
   it to run in a different directory.

Known bugs (include bugzilla ID):
                                  722 (threading slow)
                                  789 (1pt sims 2.5X slow)

One-line Summary: Add glc multi-elev classes, snow-hydrology bug-fix, new finidat files,
                  new namelist items and history fields, read aerosol and nitrogen
                  deposition in res-independent stream files fix issues for single-point,
                  mksurfdata/getregional scripts.

Purpose of changes:

  Science changes:

   Since, clm4.0.00 in the CCSM4.0 release there have been several developments made
   to clm4 (bringing us up to CLM4.0.10). A glacier multiple elevation class option 
   was added that allows the use of CLM4 with a glacier land ice model the Community 
   Ice Sheet Model (CISM).  A bug-fix for the snow hydrology was added. A minor change
   was also made in how the normalization was done for the cosine of solar zenith
   angle scaling for Solar fields in the data atmosphere model. A scaling was done
   in the first two Volatile Organic Coumpound (VOC) fields, and the ability to
   run dry-deposition in CLMCN was added.

   New initial conditions files were added in, some with small changes to fix
   a snow problem for the standard 1-degree and 2-degree cases, but also finidat files
   for 2-degree for CNDV were added.

  Software engineering changes:

   Several new namelist items were added a few new history fields. Also the capability 
   of reading aerosol and nitrogen deposition from stream files at one resolution and 
   regridded on the fly rather than with datasets at the model resolution was added in. 
   This was important for higher resolutions so that large datasets do not have to be 
   created before running the model, nor are datasets for every resolution required. 
   There was also some fixes to test cases in the CLM test suite, and the test suite was
   changed to use aerosols from datm rather than CLM. mksurfdata.pl was changed
   so that pftdyn datasets are created on the fly, rather than having fixed text files.
   A new env_conf item was added CLM_BLDNML_OPTS to feed options to the clm build-namelist
   utility. 

Known bugs (include bugzilla ID):
                                  722 (threading slow)
                                  789 (1pt sims 2.5X slow)

Describe any changes made to build system:

  New option to CLM configure: glc_nec

  glc_nec can be 0,1,3,5, or 10 and MUST match the number on the input surface dataset
  the elevation classes themselves are read from the surface dataset. Surface datasets
  are normally created with glc_nec=10 and can be run with either glc_nec=0 (default)
  or glc_nec=10 (for multiple glacier elevation classes and running with ice sheet model).

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

   New namelist items:

  carbon_only    = If true, and CLMCN carbon-nitrogen model is on, Nitrogen will be
                   prescribed rather than prognosed
                   (default false)
  create_glacier_mec_landunit = If true and glc_nec>0, glc multi-elevation landunits 
                   are created.
                   (default false)
  glc_smb        = If true, and glc_nec>0, then pass surface mass balance to CISM; else 
                   pass Growing Degree Day info.
                   (default true)
  ice_runoff     = If true, and rtm, river runoff will be split up into liquid and ice 
                   streams, otherwise ice runoff will be zero and all runoff directed 
                   to liquid stream.
                   (default true)
  ndepmapalgo    = Mapping method from Nitrogen deposition input file to the model
                   resolution (can be bilinear,nn,nnoni,nnonj,spval,copy).
                   (default bilinear)
  scaled_harvest = If true, and CLMCN, harvesting will be scaled according to coefficients
                   determined by Johann Feddema, 2009.

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

   NOTE: build-namelist now checks the validity of your namelist you generate by looking at data in the namelist_definition.xml
         file. In order to add new namelist items you need to change the code and also edit this file. To view information
         on the namelist view the file:
         models/lnd/clm/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml
         in your browser and you'll see the names, type, description and valid_values for all namelist variables.

   Changes to build-namelist:
     Transient sim_year ranges (i.e. 1850-2000)
     Remove cam_hist_case option.
     Make sure options ONLY used for stand-alone testing have a "drv_" or "datm_" prefix in them and list these
     options all together and last when asking for help from build-namelist.
   New options to build-namelist:
     -clm_usr_name     "name" Dataset resolution/descriptor for personal datasets. Default: not used
                              Example: 1x1pt_boulderCO_c090722 to describe location,
                                       number of pts, and date files created
   New list options to build-namelist:
     build-namelist -res list          # List valid resolutions
     build-namelist -mask list         # List valid land-masks
     build-namelist -sim_year list     # List valid simulation years and simulation year ranges
     build-namelist -clm_demand list   # List namelist variables including those you could demand to be included.
     build-namelist -use_case list     # List valid use-cases
     build-namelist -rcp list          # List valid representative concentration pathways
                                       # for future scenarios

One-line Summary: Get future scenarios working, finalize documentation, bring in MEGAN VOC and CNDV, simplify, mksurfdata optimization, fix bugs: snow enthalpy, BMOZ, pergro, use pft weights from fsurdat NOT finidat

Purpose of changes:

Get all of the future scenarios working (other than rcp=6.0) and get all of the datasets
for these scenarios (pftdyn, fndepdyn, and aerdep files, for rcp=2.6,4.5, and 8.5).
Finalize the User's Guide for now, with reviews from: Sam, Keith, Dave, and Sean, as
well as more work on tools chapter, and adding testing chapter in appendix. We brought
in the MEGAN version of the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) module which also reads
in VOC emission factors from the surface dataset, and hence all fsurdat files needed
to be replaced. Along with this the mksurfdata tool was changed in order to handle VOC's
and effort was made to optimize it, add shared memory paralelism, and do memory
optimization. We also removed the old Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM) and replaced
it with the Carbon Nitrogen Dynamic Vegetation model (CNDV). Make some simplifications
in the configure system to always use the CCSM version of build files, remove some 
unused options, put standalone test options last in configure. Improve documenation in
XML files for configure and build-namelist options.

Fix many different bugs. Enthalpy in snow combination was sometimes NOT conserved and now
is. There was a problem running DryDeposition for the BMOZ compset that is now fixed.
There were multiple issues running PERGRO testing that is now fixed. Previously, if 
both the finidat file and the fsurdat file had PFT weights on them, the values from
the finidat file was used, now it will use the values from the fsurdat file. There are
also several cases where if the weights are different it will abort with an error, or
at least send a message to the log file about the differences.

Describe any changes made to build system:
   Switch cndv for dgvm, Have configure disallow bad cases
   Change configure to NOT allow supln with spinup cases
   Do NOT allow exit_spinup and ad_spinup at the same time.
   Only allow voc to be set for seq_ccsm NOT ext_ccsm_seq
   Remove carbon_aero and pio from configure (always build with pio)
   emove unused configure options: clm_exe, -clm_exedir, and -clm_bld.
   Move standalone testing options to the end of help. Use CCSM version
   of mkSrcfiles/mkDepends, separate config vars into categories, work
   on documentation with comments from Keith/Sam.

Describe any changes made to the namelist:
   Add 2000-2100 simulation year range as allowed option

   Two new history fields:

        TSOI_10CM      = soil temperature in top 10cm of soil (K)
        SOILWATER_10CM = soil liquid water + ice in top 10cm of soil (kg/m2)

   Check for some files based on rcp (fpftdyn, ndepdyn, and aerdep)

   Add in ability to add a user namelist in your case directory to input
   namelist items at configure time. Simply add a file called "user_nl_clm"
   as a valid namelist and the items in that namelist will show up in the initial
   BuildConf/clm.buildnml.csh file.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:
    get urbanc_alpha grid and frac files in
    get in new single-point datasets
              new qtr-degree, T62 and T85 fsurdat
              new f10, f05, f09, 1850 fsurdat
              new rcp=8.5, f19 pftdyn, 
              new rcp=4.5 f09, f19, f10 pftdyn
              new rcp=2.6 f09, f19, f10 pftdyn
              new rcp=8.5/4.5/2.6 f19 aerdep 1850-2100 datasets
              new rcp=8.5/4.5 f19 fndepdyn 1850-2100 datasets
              new rcp=2.6/4.5 f10, f45, f25, f09 aerdep/ndepdyn datasets
              new rcp=2.6/4.5,8.5 f19 decadal averages for ndepdat
   (Note: harvest was updated in PFTDYN files and raw PFT input files for 2006).
   New 10x15 and 4x5 finidat files so that transient cases will work at those resolutions
     New finidat files for 1-deg and 2-deg (from fully coupled simulations)
     New datasets for I cases that are set in scripts
   Duplicate cn datasets for cndv
    New pft-physiology files with extra fields for CNDV
   Remove 360x720 files, gx3v5, gx1v5 files
   Remove 1x1.25, 2x2.5, and 2.5x3.33 grid resolutions
   Remove gx1v3, gx1v4, gx1v5 land masks, add drydep defaults.
   add mksrf_fvegtyp@1000-1004

Changes answers relative to baseline: Yes!
    snow change has a small effect on climate (see below)
    Bringing in MEGAN VOC changes answers for VOC fluxes in a diagnostic way
    Changing to use weights from fsurdat file rather than finidat file, changes
      answers for cases with finidat startup files, if the weights are different.

IF tag changes answers relative to baseline comparison the
following should be filled in:

  Summarize any changes to answers:
    - what code configurations: All

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

   NOTE: build-namelist now checks the validity of your namelist you generate by looking at data in the namelist_definition.xml
         file. In order to add new namelist items you need to change the code and also edit this file. To view information
         on the namelist view the file:
         models/lnd/clm/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml
         in your browser and you'll see the names, type, description and valid_values for all namelist variables.

   Changes to build-namelist:
     Transient sim_year ranges (i.e. 1850-2000)
     Remove cam_hist_case option.
     Make sure options ONLY used for stand-alone testing have a "drv_" or "datm_" prefix in them and list these
     options all together and last when asking for help from build-namelist.
   New options to build-namelist:
     -clm_usr_name     "name" Dataset resolution/descriptor for personal datasets. Default: not used
                              Example: 1x1pt_boulderCO_c090722 to describe location,
                                       number of pts, and date files created
   New list options to build-namelist:
     build-namelist -res list          # List valid resolutions
     build-namelist -mask list         # List valid land-masks
     build-namelist -sim_year list     # List valid simulation years and simulation year ranges
     build-namelist -clm_demand list   # List namelist variables including those you could demand to be included.
     build-namelist -use_case list     # List valid use-cases

One-line Summary: Fully implement sequential-ccsm mode, upgrade configure, 
         build-namelist and testing, upgrade interpolation tool, 
         add mkdatadomain, write to iulog rather than 6 explicitly, SCAM update, 
         Update datasets, add archiving, and build-streams, add in point version 
         of Urban model, change directory structure to mimic CCSM

Software engineering changes:

   Fully implement sequential-ccsm mode.
   Upgrade configure, build-namelist and testing, and build-streams.
   Upgrade interpolation tool, 
   Add mkdatadomain to convert CLM input datasets to CCSM datm7 format.
   Write to iulog rather than 6 explicitly.
   SCAM update.
   Update datasets used.
   Add archiving as a script run after model completes.
   Change directory structure to mimic CCSM.

    QUICKSTART: using the new CPL7 scripts:

         cd scripts
         ./create_newcase            # get help on how to run create_newcase
         ./create_newcase -case testI -mach blueice -res f19_g15 -compset I    # create new "I" case for blueice at 1.9x2.5_gx1v5 res
                                     # "I" case is clm active, datm7, and inactive ice/ocn
         cd testI
         configure -mach blueice     # create scripts
         testI.build                 # build model and create namelists
         bsub < testI.run            # submit script  
                                     # (NOTE: edit env_run to set RESUBMIT to number of times to automatically resubmit)

Science changes:

   Interpinic:

   Get it to work with OMP to run faster and optimized. Validate that different numbers of threads gives the same answers.
   Correct problem to find nearest points for PFT data. Get interpinic to work on a half-degree dataset. Change interpinic 
   so it doesn't work on a given set of variables -- but does all applicable variables based on a set of rules of what the
   variables dimensions are. This allows interpinic to work for CN cases.

   Urban model:

   Urban code was started by Gordon Bonan, and taken up by Mariana Vertenstein and Keith Oleson.
   This represents work that has been ongoing for several years. Revision dates go back to
   before 2003.

   Some papers on the work are available from:

   Oleson et.-al. Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, in-Press as of Jan/2008

   http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/tss/staff/oleson/publications/JAMC1598_rev_jul27_2007.pdf

   Newcn06:

   Move newcn06-02_clm3_5_00 branch tag to trunk. Add ability for CN to do pftdyn mode. Add new options to configure
   and namelist.

Known bugs (include bugzilla ID): 251 (TwoStream), 672 (3.5.4-3.5.14 diffs), 680 (t0 precip diff for seq-ccsm), 
                                  698 (cprnc bug gives false difference), 701 (svn keyword), 708, (xlf bug on bluevista)
                                  717 (archiving bug -- only archive 1000 files at a time), 724 (cprnc core dumps)
                                 1079 (rpointer file updated with clm.i files)
                                 1083 (Units of NEE exported should be kg CO2 NOT kg C)

    Known bugs that will NOT be resolved: 512 (mksurf on PGI), 546(interpinic for DGVM), 
                                          694 (restarts for offline) , 
                                          652 (threads different answers with older PGI versions)
                                          725 (bug in offline mode for lightning with ifort compiler)

Describe any changes made to build system:

   Add new options to configure

     -ad_spinup    Turn on AD_SPINUP mode for bgc setting of CN [on | off]
     -exit_spinup  Turn on EXIT_SPINUP mode for bgc setting of CN [on | off]
     -pergro       Switch enables building CLM for perturbation growth tests.

   Add BUILDPIO CPP variable

   Implement a build-namelist script to create namelists for you:

build-namelist -help
SYNOPSIS
     build-namelist [options]
OPTIONS
     -cam_config "file"      Read the CAM config cache file (rather than the CLM version) to get
                             build-time configuration information.

     -ignore_ic_year         Ignore just the year part of the date on the initial condition files (ic_ymd and ic_tod)
                             when determining what input initial condition file to use.
     -infile "file"          Specify a namelist file to read values from.

Note: The precedence for setting the values of namelist variables is (highest to lowest):
      1. interactive prompting,
      2. namelist values set by specific command-line options, e.g., -case -start_type and -ignore_ic_date,
      3. values set on the command-line using the -namelist option,
      4. values read from the file specified by -infile,
      5. values specified by the -use_case option,
      6. values from defaults files in the CLM configuration
         script directory.

      Use the "drv_in" 'virtual namelist' to have build-namelist decide which namelist
      to put driver control information in.
 Use build-streams for sequential-CCSM
  Builds the streams files on the fly. This allows running data over any period.
  Add usecase option to build-namelist to set multiple things (currently only implementing pergro and pergro0)
  Add notes to namelist files generated with build-namelist so can reconstruct.
  See details of new build-namelist options in documentation on build-namelist below.

Describe timing and memory performance:

   On blueice

       128 Tasks, nosmp   = 1.9x2.5_gx1v5 resolution:  115 sim-years/Wall-Day 
                                                        61 sim-years/Wall-Day (CN mode) 3.9 GBytes memory
	64 Tasks, nosmp   = 1.9x2.5_gx1v5 resolution:  143 sim-years/Wall-Day
                                                        73 sim-years/Wall-Day (CN mode) 2.1 GBytes memory
	32 Tasks, nosmp   = 1.9x2.5_gx1v5 resolution:  131 sim-years/Wall-Day 
                                                        60 sim-years/Wall-Day (CN mode) 2.2 GBytes memory
	32 threads, nospmd= 1.9x2.5_gx1v5 resolution:   98 sim-years/Wall-Day 
                                                        49 sim-years/Wall-Day (CN mode) 1.7 GBytes memory
         8 Tasks, nosmp   = 1.9x2.5_gx1v5 resolution:   88 sim-years/Wall-Day 
                                                        38 sim-years/Wall-Day (CN mode) 774 MBytes memory
       Note: With 64 Tasks CLM is spending roughly 40% of it's time on I/O. Hence, increasing the processor
             count doesn't increase the throughput -- since I/O is only on one task.

   Depending on the configuration -- offline mode is about the same to 168% slower (in CN mode)

Tag name:  clm3_5_00
Originator(s):  erik (Erik Kluzek)

Date:One-line Summary: New surface datasets, improved canopy integration, and various improvements to Hydrology

Purpose of changes (Since CLM3.0):

  CLM3.5 is considerably different to CLM3.0, particularly with respect to its 
  simulation of the hydrologic cycle.   The modifications consist of new surface 
  datasets based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products 
  (Lawrence and Chase 2007), an improved canopy integration scheme 
  (Thornton and Zimmermann 2007), scaling of canopy interception (Lawrence et al. 2007), 
  a simple TOPMODEL-based model for surface and sub-surface runoff (Niu et al. 2005), a 
  simple groundwater model for determining water table depth (Niu et al. 2007), and a 
  new frozen soil scheme (Niu and Yang 2006).  

  There are four additional modifications.  Three of these, an improved description of 
  soil water availability, a resistance term to reduce excessive soil evaporation, and the
  introduction of a factor to simulate nitrogen limitation on plant productivity, can be 
  categorized as new or improved parameterizations from the perspective of CLM3.  The 
  other may be categorized as fixing an algorithmically defective existing parameterization
  (correction to snowage calculation so that snowage increases monotonically) 
  (Dickinson et al. 2006).

  See:

  http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/tss/clm/distribution/clm3.5/

  for more information, and for technical and scientific papers that describe CLM3.5.

  Lastly, we are distributing a new forcing dataset with the new code.  This
  dataset was derived by combining observation-based analyses of monthly precipitation and
  surface air temperature with intramonthly variations from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis 
  (Qian et al., 2006)

  If you would like to run CLM-CN, please contact Peter Thornton (thornton@ucar.edu).
  If you would like to run CLM-DGVM, please contact Sam Levis (slevis@ucar.edu).
  If you would like to run CLM-CASA', please contact Forrest Hoffman (hof@ornl.gov).

Describe any bug fixes:

  o A revision of RTM-subcycling and corrections to a few land-locked grid cells.
  o A more efficient soil evaporation calculation based on PFT demand.
  o A fix to aggregation of LAI from high-resolution source data to CLM surface data.
  o Changing Temperature of freezing of water from 273.16 (triple point of water) to 273.15.

Summarize any software engineering improvements:

  o Add option to run CLM at a finer resolution than the atmospheric model coupled to
     (Tony Craig and others)
  o MCT (Model Coupling Toolkit) used to describe decompositions and do redistributions.
  o Remove dependences on CAM modules and data structures.
  o Use csm_share clocks and CCSMInit objects for simulation time information and
    initialization information needed by all CCSM models.
  o Update time-management to ESMF_2_2_2r interfaces and use the WRF implementation of
    ESMF time-management modules.
  o Made restart datasets double precision NetCDF rather than binary 
    (except history restarts).
  o Add interface layers to link to Sequential CCSM (formally standalone CAM) using MCT.
  o Parallelize RTM, by Tony Craig and Pat Worley.
  o Add a new testing suite to do automated testing for any code changes.
  o Improve memory scaling with a new decomposition from Tony Craig.
  o Move make surface dataset capability to an offline tool (mksurfdata).
  o Add an offline tool to create grid datasets needed for initialization (mkgriddata).
  o Add ability to run concurrent CCSM in single-executable mode.
  o Running with SCAM (Single Column Atmospheric Model) mode modularized better.

Versions of any externally defined libraries: (under src/utils)

  o csm_share:        share3_070321 (add flds, eshr and dshr directories, 
                                     add shr_inputinfo_mod, eshr_timemgr_mod, 
                                     other modules for shared data work)
  o esmf_wrf_timemgr: esmf_wrf_timemgr_060616 (or can link to full ESMF_2_2_2r)
  o timing:           timing_070328 (extensive updates and utilize PAPI and new namelist)
  o mct:              MCT2_3_0_070206 (allow to build with code, Cray mods, misc.)

Describe any changes made to build system: 

  o A configure script was created to create files needed to build the model. 
  o There are also cshell run scripts for different platforms to: 
       configure, build and run the model.
  o Remove SPMD CPP token -- use src/utils/mct/mpi-serial library for serial mode.
  o Remove HIDE_MPI token.
  o Remove CAM and COUP_CAM CPP tokens -- replace with SEQ_MCT and SEQ_ESMF.
  o Remove NOCOMPETE CPP token.
  o Most SCAM #ifdef's removed.
  o Remove TIMING_BARRIERS CPP token -- add option to prof_inparm namelist.
  o See src/utils/timing for new tokens added for timing library 
     (HAVE_PAPI, THREADED_OMP, DIAG, HASH).
  o MCT included with offline CLM.

  Build features added -- but unsupported for public release:

  o Port to jaguar.ccs.ornl.gov (Cray XT3/XT4)
  o Port to Bluegene/L (frost.ucar.edu) (add BGL CPP token)
  o Port to lightning.ucar.edu (frost.ucar.edu with Pathscale)
  o Add SINGLE_EXEC CPP token for running concurrent CCSM in single-executable mode.
  o Add CN CPP token and CN BGC code.
  o Add NO_FIRE CPP token for use by CN mode.
  o Add AD_SPINUP and EXIT_SPINUP CPP token for initial spinup of CN.
  o Add DUST and PROGSST CPP tokens.
  o Add COUP_WRF CPP token.

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

  Main namelist name changed from clmexp to clm_inparm

  Option to run clm at a finer mesh than the atmosphere added several namelist items.

  flndtopo        = 256 character land topography file name
  fatmgrid        = 256 character atmosphere grid data file name
  fatmlndfrc      = 256 character landfrac (on atm grid) file name
  fatmtopo        = 256 character atmosphere topography file name

  Decomposition/performance control:

  nsegspc         = Number of segments per clump for new decomp. 
                    1 will produce poor loadbalance, infinity yields too many
                    segments per pe but good load balance. (default 20)

  All mksrf_* options moved to the mksurfdata offline tool. So instead of
  creating surface datasets by running clm -- you run the mksurfdata tool
  to create them.

  mksrf_* = Removed from namelist.

  Miscellaneous:

  rest_flag            = logical, turns restart file writing on (default .true.)
  wrtdia               = true if want output written  (default .false.)
  create_crop_landunit = true => separate crop landunit is not created by default
                         (currently broken see KnownBugs) (default .false.)

  New prof_inparm namelist added for timing library.

   profile_single_file  = Write timing output to single file or file per task 
                          (default single)
   profile_disable      = Turn timing off. (default .false.)
   profile_barrier      = Turn MPI barriers on in t_barrierf calls. (default .false.)
   profile_depth_limit  = Integer indicating maximum number of levels of timer nesting 
                          (default 99999)
   profile_detail_limit = integer indicating maximum detail level to profile (default 0)
   profile_timer        = integer indicating which timer to use
      GPTLwall           = 1
      GPTLcpu            = 2
      GPTLabort_on_error = 3
      GPTLoverhead       = 4
      GPTLdepthlimit     = 5
      GPTLgettimeofday   = 6
      GPTLnanotime       = 7
      GPTLrtc            = 8
      GPTLmpiwtime       = 9
      GPTLclockgettime   = 10
      GPTLpapitime       = 11
      (default is 9, except on UNICOSMP where it is 8)

  Namelist items added -- but unsupported in public release:

  co2_type             = values of 'prognostic','diagnostic','constant' 
                         (only constant mode for OFFLINE)

  CASA':

  spunup   =  0=no, 1=yes (used with nsrest/=1 only)   (default 0)
  lalloc   =  0=fixed allocation, 1=dynamic allocation (default 1)
  lnpp     =  1=gpp*gppfact,2=fn(lgrow)*gppfact        (default 2)
  q10      =  temperature dependence                   (default 2.0)
  fcpool   =  Carbon Pool initial state filename

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

 Use following files for T42 resolution:

 finidat        = '$CSMDATA/inidata_3.1/offline/clmi_0000-01-01_064x128_c070403.nc'
